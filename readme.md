# RL-Travelling Salesman Problem :robot:
----------------------------------

Our project is based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for solving Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). Our code and experiments around the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04240.

We consider solving TCP solving with RL based on [Pointer Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03134).

As the dataset 20 uniform distributed points from 0 to 1 for each coordinates were used.

For each dataset 4 different types of embeddings were used:

:lock: Linear layer;

:lock: Simple node encoding throw dot product with a random vector;

:lock: Node2Vec;

:lock: DeepWalk.
